== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I put my custom stylesheet? =

You will need to use an FTP client to add the `/bns-customs/` folder under the `/wp-content/` folder, then place your `bns-custom-style.css` file in the `/bns-customs/` folder.

= Why did you add the `/bns-customs/` folder? =

The `/bns-customs/` folder will be used as an update safe location for all plugins I write.
As most of these plugins use the "BNS" designator, the folder name will make it easier to locate your customizations.

= Can I use this in more than one widget area? =

Yes, this plugin has been made for multi-widget compatibility. Each instance of the widget will display, if wanted, differently than every other instance of the widget.

= How can I style the plugin output? =

The plugin uses several "common" WordPress functions that create standard class and id elements that can be styled in the style.css file
* the classes generated by the post_class() function; and, the id generated by "post-" appended to the_ID() function wrap the general post output
* the plugin class `post-details` wraps the general meta details of the post, such as the Author, Categories, Tags, etc.
* the overall plugin may also be wrapped in a widget "container" class, or id, specific to the theme itself such as (but not limited to): widget, sidebar, left, right, etc.

As of version 1.9, you may create a custom stylesheet using the name `bnsfc-custom-style.css`; and save it to the BNS Featured Category plugin folder.
Elements you add into this file will not be overwritten with future plugin updates. With the addition of the display Category Description option an additional class was written into the plugin.
To style the category description displayed add the class 'bnsfc-cat-desc' to your bnsfc-custom-style.css file then use your choice of properties to style the text, for example:
`
.bnsfc-cat-desc {font-style: italic;}
`

= What style elements are specifically generated by the plugin?

The following CSS elements are generated by the plugin code:

* .bns-featured-category
* .bnsfc-widget-title
* .bnsfc-container
* .bnsfc-link
* .bnsfc-cat-class-< category choice(s) >
* .bnsfc-cat-desc
* .bnsfc-clear
* .bnsfc-content
* .bnsfc-no-posts-message

Additional style elements may be available but are most likely created through WordPress core functionality, the current active Theme, or another active plugin.

= Can I increase the maximum posts to display? =

As of version 1.6.2 the Total Posts to Display is independent of the "posts per page" setting as set under Settings | Reading.
